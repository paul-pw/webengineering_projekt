Jekyll is a static site generation tool based on ruby. Nuxt is similar but based on vue and NodeJs.

This site used to be done in Jekyll and was intended to be hosted on github. But the Project got abandoned in an unuseable state as other stuff had come up that was more important.  

With webengeneering class, this Project has risen from the dead. There had to be major work done to fix all the flaws the site had previosly and port everything to nuxt and vue.

In the end it was all worth it. The site is looking better than ever and has even gained a few new features.
