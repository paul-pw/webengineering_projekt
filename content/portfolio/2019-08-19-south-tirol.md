# South Tirol
Mountains, thats probably the first thing that comes to Mind when thinking about South Tirol.  
Just Like they can be seen in this Image. But opposite to what you'd think when thinking mountains, it was pretty hot when we were there
and South Tirol also isn't all about Mountains, the valleys are also quite beautiful and the figs that grow there are very delicious.

## a chapel
When hiking somewhere midway up a mountain, we came across this small chapel.

## Castles
While hiking on the Waalweg paths all around Meran, we came across lots of these small castles, they are mostly uninhabited and sadly also not open to the Public, which is sad because the view from these would probably be magnificent.
