# Storm
I like this Image because it shows the strength of Nature. When I look at this Image I feel taken back to this day, the trees where moving because of the strong winds and once in a while you could hear an occasional creaking noise from the trees.  
This Image captures the moving trees and the fast movement of the Clouds. The general darkness adds to the feeling of the Image
