# Borkum
the Island of Borkum in the North of Germany is popular destination to go on vacation. unfortunately there are very few good places to take photos. No beautiful cliffs, no Rocks at the Beach...  
But Sometimes the Beauty lies in the Simplicity like in this Image. Just the moon, the Water and a bit of the Beach Promenade.

But Borkum has still a little more to show. Like the old Lighthouse and the Dunes.
